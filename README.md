local-containers
=======================================

Local containers repository provides a set of biocontainers that can not be distributed automatically by BioContainers due the following reasons: 
 

* Licensed software that should be downloaded manually from the providers: Some software can not be distributed without the autorization of the original providers. 

* Software requesting manual downloaded: Some providers request manual download of their software for funding purpose or other reasons. 

In these cases the BioDcontainers community will provide a customized Dockerfile and README pages to assit the build locally. Also, the biocontainers community will activelly 
support these containers and the users can be in contact with the developers by creating an issue [here](https://github.com/BioContainers/local-containers/issues)
